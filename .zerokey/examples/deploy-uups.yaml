# Example: UUPS Upgradeable Contract Deployment
# This configuration deploys an upgradeable contract using the UUPS proxy pattern
# See: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable

network: sepolia
contract: ExampleUUPS

# Proxy configuration
proxy:
  # Proxy type: "uups" uses ERC1967Proxy with UUPS upgrade pattern
  type: uups

  # Initialize function arguments (passed to initialize() after deployment)
  # For ExampleUUPS, initialize(address initialOwner)
  initializeArgs:
    - "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb"  # initialOwner address

# Constructor arguments for the implementation contract
# UUPS upgradeable contracts typically don't use constructor args (use initialize instead)
constructorArgs: []

# ETH value to send with deployment (usually "0" for proxies)
value: "0"

# Optional: Gas settings
# gasLimit: 5000000
# gasPrice: "20000000000"  # 20 gwei
